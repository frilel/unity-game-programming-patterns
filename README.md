This fork is for my own personal use. Expanding with other patterns I want to save.

The forked repo is presented in this blog post: https://blog.unity.com/games/level-up-your-code-with-game-programming-patterns

# Notes for myself
+ Look at Unity's [Open Game Project](https://resources.unity.com/unitenow/open-projects) for more/alternative patterns. Uses ScriptableObject for many systems. Shorter versions as [Devlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLDgtRNK2VE).
